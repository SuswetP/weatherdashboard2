Weather Dashboard API Integration Challenge
Your task is to create a weather dashboard that fetches and displays the current
weather and a 5-day forecast for a user-specified location. The application should use
the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data.
Requirements
1. Create an input field where the user can enter a city name or ZIP/postal code to
search for weather data.
2. Display current weather information for the specified location, including:
● City name
● Current temperature
● Weather description (e.g., clear sky, light rain)
● Weather icon
● Humidity
● Wind speed
● Pressure
3. Display a 5-day forecast for the specified location, including:
● Date
● Average temperature
● Weather description
● Weather icon
4. Handle potential errors, such as invalid input, API request failures, and data
parsing issues.
5. Implement a responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile
devices.
API Reference
Use the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the required data. Sign up for a free API key at
https://openweathermap.org/appid.
Evaluation Criteria
Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
1. Correctness: The application should fetch and display accurate weather data
according to the provided location.

2. Code quality: The code should be well-structured, modular, and follow best
practices.
3. Error handling: The application should gracefully handle potential errors and edge
cases.
Notes
● The entire problem must be solved with the aid of ChatGPT to assist with
understanding the OpenWeatherMap API, troubleshooting issues, and exploring
best practices for API integration and application development.
● You can use any front-end framework or library you prefer, such as React,
Angular, or Vue.js, or vanilla JavaScript. Bonus points for using Emberjs.
● It is recommended that you use Tailwind CSS to streamline the design process.
